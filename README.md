# VLC-RPC
An updated Discord rich presence for VLC media player.

This is a modified version of the [Pigpog/vlc-discord-rpc project](https://github.com/Pigpog/vlc-discord-rpc), which is no longer being actively maintained. We have updated and enhanced the project by adding a ton of new features, such as album and show covers.
